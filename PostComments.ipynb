I send a very good amount of likes &amp; will send comments on 50-60% depending on interest level &amp; prompts. \\n6. Looking for somebody genuine, funny, witty, and obviously physical attraction is huge. Love some sarcasm &amp; good banter.',\n",
       "  '* **Photo #1**: Car selfies look low effort. Lack of eye contact and toothy smile really hurt your first photo. In general, this photo tells me nothing about you, so it\\'s wasted space. I\\'d cut and replace it with a photo of you making eye contact with the camera in natural lighting giving your best, most natural smile. Ideally you should look as attractive as you can.\\n* **Prompt #1**: This made me smile, but here\\'s my opinion. This tells me nothing about you, yes it\\'s a joke and I\\'m sure you added it to show your sense of humor, but anybody could look up a list of dad jokes and put this in---there\\'s no *you* in this prompt. Second, your first prompt is part of your first impression, alongside your first photo. Is this really the most important thing you want to tell your audience?\\n* **Bio**: This looks fine. I\\'d consider just putting long-term. Some people will read \"long, open to short\" as \"I just want hookups, but don\\'t want you to know that\". I like your addition under that though.\\n* **Photo #2**: Car selfies are low effort and making signs with your hands are juvenile (and lose the hat, don\\'t want to look like you\\'re hiding a bald spot, especially this early in your profile). This also tells me nothing about you, except you have tattoos, which some women are very into, so it does have that going for it. There are certainly much more flattering ways to do show those off though.\\n* **Photo #3**: Absolutely not. Who\\'s the woman? Why are you sitting *right up against her*? Is she your girlfriend? Your ex? I don\\'t know. And your audience doesn\\'t either, but it will make them suspicious, and that\\'s death. Cut this immediately. Are you a closed mouth smiler? I am too, but you need to find a way for these photos (especially the first one) to get a natural looking toothy smile.\\n* **Prompt #2**: Generic. Cut this and give me something about you. Show me examples, don\\'t just tell me you are. \"Sarcasm\" is a cliche on dating profiles, remove this immediately.\\n* **Photo #4**: This looks like an injoke. I\\'d cut it, as it will alienate people who don\\'t get it. Other than that, it\\'s hard for me to comment.\\n* **Prompt #5**: You and everyone else with a Google search. Where\\'s the *you* in this?\\n* **Photo #5**: See my comment for photo #3. Cut this immediately.\\n* **Photo #6**: This is fine. I\\'d keep this for the short term, maybe move it up to slot 3 or so. In the long term, give me an action shot of you actually playing baseball. If you\\'re super recognizable in that, it could do a lot of work in one of the earlier slots. If you\\'re not, it\\'s still a good addition in slot 4 or 5.\\n\\nOverall, the biggest problem with your profile is that I don\\'t know anything about you. You play baseball, but that\\'s all I know. You need to find more facets of yourself to share with your audience, and you need to find ways to show those off through pictures. You also need a strong opening photo more than anything else, so I\\'d start with that.'],\n",

For the prompt about them, go with “What I’d Love to Know About You Is” and secretly make it about you. For example, if you like to go to concerts, say “last concert you went to”. BOOM. Says you like concerts and gives you something to talk about.\\n\\nGood luck bro'],\n",

If you have one where you're facing the camera and smiling, I’d suggest swapping it with that one and maybe even using it as your first picture.\\n\\nPhoto 5: he angle of this photo isn't that great. If you're going to take a selfie, make sure your full face is in the frame and smile of course :)\\n\\nPhoto 6: Similar to photo 4, I love the ocean view and you nailed the idea of a selfie. However, you look a bit angry in that picture, which doesn't feel very welcoming.\\n\\nYou seem to be getting a lot of likes, so it looks like you're doing well! I’d just suggest revamping your pictures. Consider taking some photos around your area and aim for more candid shots.

The first date preferences is okay but the other two made me physically cringe. As did the “the company of me will help too” (I don’t totally hate the concept, but the execution was just off for me.) I think you need a funny comment on there and/or something a bit outlandish or oddly specific, as I found your answers a bit dry. I don’t know that any one of your prompts is particularly bad, but to me the sum of them gives NPC Hinge profile. If I had to pick one comment to swap out, it would probably be the second one but again they’re all cut from the same cloth so it doesn’t make a ton of difference. \\n\\nAs far as the photos, I feel like captioned pictures are tacky in general so I would take those out (except the pool one is funny and maybe you can leave comment if you’ve been here). The pictures are a bit homogeneous too: a lot sitting down, a lot of solo shots, a lot of t-shirts, and I’m just now realizing two from the same day (lol). If you have a sport you like to play or a hiking shot or something outdoorsy, I would flex that. \\n\\nI can’t speak to the voice prompt, but those can be hit or miss. \\n\\nAll in all, I really don’t think it’s that bad, just little things I would do differently myself and just my humble opinion. Any one tiny thing could be the reason someone isn’t liking your profile, so even a winning profile will get a lot of swing and misses. It’s brutal out there man, I’m just getting back into Hinge again and it’s been a battle for me too. Maybe broaden your scope as well, though I guess if you’re maxing out likes it doesn’t make a difference. In any case, happy swiping',\n",

Unfortunately, the majority of the likes are low quality (I define low quality as the profiles aren’t filled out, the person doesn’t respond with anything in my profile, the profile has just selfies in a car or mirror, or the profile has something akin to “good men finish last” “just seeing how this goes” or “I don’t know what I want”). The likes that are quality tend to be the most attractive but don’t respond, because they tend to be the top tier of attractiveness and so likely have a lot of options to choose from, or they are attractive but clearly not interested but chat anyway. I send likes to anyone who I find attractive, has a filled out profile, and has varied photos. The men I’m attracted to are varied. I am seeking a man who is assertive, knows what he wants, has a life and interests as shown by their profile photos and responses, and is confident and compassionate.

       "  '&gt; Hi! I started off strong with over a dozen Likes at first but dwindled to 1 Like or response every 2-3 weeks. I\\'ve used Boost and got some responses but they weren\\'t what I was looking for.\\n\\nJust so you know this is an extremely typical experience for a male Hinge user who just signs up. They put you in front of lots of women at first to get you hooked and then bury your profile in the hopes that you\\'ll buy Boosts/upgrade to a paid subscription. The trouble is attractive women have so many likes from men that a lot of them (maybe the vast majority of women) **do not even bother looking at the general pile/shuffle Hinge gives them because they can just go through their enormous pile of likes every day and swipe/left right to match** and this is true across all dating apps. Another structural problem is that [men are way less picky than women when it comes to swiping](https://np.reddit.com/r/hingeapp/comments/1dnu61u/getting_no_likes_as_a_man_on_hinge_is_very_common/la7qt3h/) and so, in aggregate, male indiscriminate right-swiping just creates and compounds the male-female disparity in user experiences.\\n\\nWhich is a very long way of saying that **the few women who are spending time liking male profiles tend to be the ones with the smallest pile of male likes to regularly sort through**, which is almost certainly why your Boost \"got responses but they weren\\'t what I was looking for.\" No matter how good your profile is, that\\'s generally not going to change the overall dating app landscape or your experience when it comes to likes that you receive. Improving your profile has to be combined with a pro-active policy of sending likes/roses.\\n\\nWith profile photos, direct, clear, high quality shots of your face, preferably smiling, are the way to go generally speaking and photos 2 and 6 are probably your best from that standpoint. Your first photo would be perfect if you weren\\'t looking off into the distance, but if you keep 2 and 6 photo 1 combined with those will give you a good sense of what you look like. That said, photos 2 and 6 suffer from being selfies—they\\'re a little bland from a color perspective and the lighting isn\\'t the best either. You might want to consider getting professional headshots done (like I did, because my selfies are usually mediocre/bad) and using some of the photos for LinkedIn as well, I got *GQ*-quality/style ones done for my profile and when a pro photographer can make you look like a model-esque, people notice and react accordingly.\\n\\nI would suggest replacing photos 3, 4, and 5 because they violate the general rule of thumb re: direct, clear, high quality headshots on a bunch of levels. They\\'re all either too far away, your face is blocked in whole or in part (helmet/glasses), the quality is poor, and so on. That said I think you are on the right track with what you\\'re trying to communicate with those photos in terms of activities, being fun/funny. That\\'s good.\\n\\nSame thing with the \"fight me\" prompt. You\\'re trying to be playful and funny, I get it, but \"fight me\" is really not something you want to write in a prompt for a dating app for any reason. Because it can evoke images in a woman\\'s head of fighting you, either in an argument or in actual hand-to-hand combat. It\\'s the sort of thing debate bros on the internet say to each other, I don\\'t think you would ever say that phrase to a woman in real life that you\\'re trying to charm/seduce/impress. I think the \"Controversial Opinion\" prompt can be a hard one to write something good for because it just invites people to be too edgy/confrontational and that generally repels women instead of attracting them. If you want some awesome examples of well-written light-hearted and funny prompts see [1](https://archive.is/e8Fac), [2](https://archive.is/hDqAt), [3](https://archive.is/Ijp0w), [4](https://archive.is/WaKdT), [5](https://archive.is/zFoQC), and [6](https://archive.is/AH3Rj). (I wish mine were as good as these.) The easiest fix on this would be to just remove the text that comes after the \"tiny pieces\" bit.\\n\\nIf it matters I\\'m also a 41M (Asian). After being on Hinge for 6+ months now and having some matches and dates, I\\'ve concluded that the biggest thing working against me is height (or lack thereof; 5\\'5\"). I\\'m as tall as the average woman more or less and most women want someone at least a few inches taller than themselves, so I have to use a dealbreaker height filter to weed out like 75% of women and restrict myself to the shorties.\\n\\nHope that helps!',\n",

Each dating app has its own unique subculture and user base and sometimes what will fly on X will not fly on Y.

I don't really have anything positive to say about it either though.\\n* **Bio**: This looks fine.\\n* **Photo #2**: Looks like a video, so I can't really comment. This is probably fine, especially if it is showing off you at Latin dance.\\n* **Photo #3**: Nope nope nope. You're looking to date women, so why on Earth are you showing yourself with another woman? Your audience doesn't know who she is; is she your ex? Your fiance? Your sister? They don't know! And guess what? They're going to assume the worst, or at best they're going to be derailed from thinking about you to wondering about her. Cut this photo immediately. And no, I don't care that you put an emoji over her face, especially when you chose a kissy face emoji?? Bro. Positives: those are some niiiice forearms you're showing off there, keep that up. Just not in this photo.\\n* **Prompt #2**: Nope. This is nothing. Cut this and give me something about *you*. Something that lets me in, something that shows me who you are.\\n* **Photo #4**: Video, can't comment. Be careful about gym photos though.\\n* **Prompt #3**: This is fine. Cut the last one, it can be read as you being bitter. Find something to replace it.\\n* **Photo #5**: Okay, I like this. I think you should move it a little higher up. Don't open with it, but this is buried at 5.\\n* **Photo #6**: Video, can't comment. I wouldn't end on this, since the focus won't be on you and people remember firsts and lasts best. If a woman gets to the end of your profile, you want something strong for her to end on.\\n\\nOverall I think your photos are fine---the videos are hard for me to comment on, and based off a couple you're definitely able to sell what you look like, but your first photo, you first impression, is not doing that. That's probably the biggest thing. I'm really not into your prompts, probably because they're mostly lists which don't give a lot of detail about yourself, so they come off as generic. I'm also not a huge fan of ending every single bullet point with an emoji. I'm not going to tell you to stop that, because it's your profile, your vibe to project.

A tailored suit or formal wear. Maybe one of you at a bar or club looking nice. Also i don’t like the first picture with headphones gives smash player vibes. Good luck brother!',\n",
       "  '4-5 matches a month seems like decent success. There\\'s a lot of flakiness built into online dating where most matches won\\'t actually meet up with you and it\\'s largely out of your control due to timing of how they are with other matches or maybe even they\\'re just swiping for an ego boost. However, you could increase your \"hit rate\" a bit by focusing on making your messages great. And, you could still get more matches by optimizing your profile a bit...\\n\\nYou\\'re a handsome guy but your selection of photos/videos isn\\'t doing you justice. You\\'re leading off with a close up selfie of only your face, no bueno. I like the hanggliding (I think?) pic since it\\'s a cool activity. And then, it\\'s four videos. We can barely see you in three of them - you look good in the karaoke one but whether or not it works is really contingent on if your singing voice is decent, I\\'ll let you be the judge of that. So I\\'d get a few more photos where you\\'re smiling for the camera.\\n\\nI generally like your prompts but you may want to rework the \"unusual skills\" one. It reads like you butt into other people\\'s arguments and bore people with into-the-weeds details when going to museums. Neither of which are appealing traits. Maybe expand on how good of a cook you are to brag about yourself!',\n",
       "  '• Are you looking for something serious or casual?\\n\\nI lean towards something serious, but on a short-term scale. I\\'d say that I\\'d want things to grow to something more serious, but I am fine if things don\\'t last long. Casual dates are fine, but it\\'s probably better if I date someone who\\'s in the States for a few weeks/months.\\n\\n• How long have you been using this current version of your profile? How long have you been on Hinge?\\n\\nI changed the profile picture a week ago and added the video of me playing tennis 1-2 weeks ago. The \"geek out\" prompt I was inspired by a previous post posted a few days ago who had something similar. I figured it\\'s good to have my interests listed out. The original prompt was, and I\\'m paraphrasing here. \"Someone help me find my wallet that fell in the ocean. It had a $2 bill and a ticket for The Incredibles 2. I\\'m not a swimmer, so if you are, please assist.\" There\\'s was one person who responded to that prompt and seemed to find it funny. We spoke for a few days and but then stopped chatting.\\n\\nThe rest of my profile has been the same for at least a month.\\n\\nThis is my 2nd Hinge account that I have had since May 2023. The first one was from at least December 2021. I wasn\\'t finding any success. Not a lot of likes, and when I matched with someone, the conversations, while some were interesting, didn\\'t last long or lead to a date. I took a break from Hinge for a few months and decided to start fresh with a new account. I\\'ve been doing a lot better on the new account.\\n\\n•How often do you use Hinge?\\n\\nI check every day. I use up all my likes in one day at least once a week. \\n\\n•How many likes are you sending? How many with or without comments?\\n\\n2-5 likes sent a day. 80% of the time, I send comments. Sometimes, I want my first comment to be an open-ended question relating to something in their prompts or pictures. Other times, some profiles don\\'t offer a lot to comment about, but the person seems interesting, but I\\'m not going to ask, \"How\\'s your day been?\". So, I just sent a like, but no comment. Does anyone relate to this? \\n\\n• How many likes/matches are you getting on average?\\n\\n0-1 likes a month. I wanna say at least 4-5 matches a month. Depending on who I match with, conversations can last days where it\\'s usually 1-2 messages a day. Sometimes, it\\'s even weeks without asking them out. Some matches I like, but I\\'m not completely sure I want to ask them out yet, considering how slow the chats go. Other matches can get fast-paced, and then I\\'ll just ask them if their free to date, but the majority of the time, they either stop responding or unmatch.\\n\\n•What is the type of person you send likes to and ideally want to match with? What is the type of person you want to attract? \\n\\nSomeone whose prompts and profile are usually \"random but cohesive\" and \"silly but serious.\" Those are fun to read, and if interesting enough, I\\'ll like and comment. Sometimes, structured prompts that highlight similar interests or are just interesting to read are good for me as well. Honestly, someone who, when I read their profile it makes me think, \"She just like me fr fr.',\n",

Kept the same prompts, but totally rewrote the answers\\n3. Made everything in “About me” visible\\n4. Removed explanations from relationship type and dating intentions\\n5. Performed a “Fresh Start”\\n\\nAdditional changes I am considering making:\\n\\n1. Hiding my university name. Just to clarify, it's actually listed on my profile, I just anonymized it for Reddit.

I got a few matches earlier last week, but since then activity has gone back to zero**\\n* How many likes are you sending? How many with comments? How many without comments?\\n   * **Sending 15-20 per day, with HingeX. Around 75% now with comments. Of \\\\~300 likes sent, I have received 3 matches.**\\xa0\\n* What is the type of person you send likes to and ideally want to match with? What kind of person do you want to attract?\\n   * **Looking for someone who is intelligent, responsible, disciplined, and looking for a serious relationship. Ideally someone who is also very into fitness and career motivated, but I also don’t want a carbon copy of myself. I have no qualms with dating someone who is on a different career trajectory, or who isn’t as serious about fitness.

And how long is your overall time on Hinge?\\n   - How often do you use Hinge per week?\\n   - How many likes/matches are you receiving on average?\\n   - How many likes are you sending? How many with comments? How many without comments?\\n   - What is the type of person you send likes to and ideally want to match with? What kind of person do you want to attract?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your post WILL NOT be approved until the above questions have been answered &lt;em&gt;fully&lt;/em&gt;. Failing to answer these questions in a timely manner will result in your post being removed.

If you want more immediate feedback, update your original posts instead. Deleting your original post will not work.

Any troll, hateful, misandric, misogynistic, incel, or unhelpful comments such as &amp;quot;I would date you,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;How are you not getting matches?&amp;quot; or unrelated to the profile will be removed and you will be banned.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To the original poster and commenters:&lt;/strong&gt; Please report any inappropriate or abusive messages and individuals so proper actions can be taken.

Drinks on me if you can guess my daily snack.&amp;quot; Remember, a ton of women in this age range grew up filling out quizzes in Cosmo magazine. We love a goofy question with potential ridiculous answers!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I think you&amp;#39;re super close to having a &amp;quot;must swipe&amp;quot; profile, so don&amp;#39;t get in your head about all the different picture feedback.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;',\n",
